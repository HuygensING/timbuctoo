# Asciidoc documentation pipeline

The scripts in this folder will build the timbuctoo documentation. 

The following scripts are available

build.sh::
  This script runs the actual asciidoc build. 
  It results in a set of HTML files in ./output.
  It requires a functioning asciidoctor installation, the easiest way to get it is through docker.
  You can run the script using `docker run -it -v $PWD:/documents asciidoctor ./documentation/asciidoc-pipeline/build.sh`
watchbuild.sh::
  This script calls build.sh whenever one of the input files change.
  You can run the script using `docker run -it -v $PWD:/documents asciidoctor ./documentation/asciidoc-pipeline/watchbuild.sh`
gh-pages.sh::
  This script assumes that a build has been run and then creates a new commit on the gh-pages branch with the contents of output.
  You can run the script using `./gh-pages.sh` after you have run build.sh (so this script should not be run in a container, it only requires git).
