= RDF import

== Summary
//tag::summary[]
The RDF importer can be provided with a dataset in n-triples format that will then be inserted as-is into the database.
//end::summary[]

 * todo:feature[An extra piece of provenance should be generated, listing the person who uploaded the file and the name or url of the file (if available to the server).]
 * todo:feature[The endpoint should be able to download datasets from the internet directly.] 

== Context
RDF is a widely used linked data format. 
Therefore Timbuctoo has to communicate with a with services through the RDF data format. 
This package contains a mapping to convert RDF to the Timbuctoo native property graph format. 
The RDF syntax we support are n-quads. Because n-quads are a superset of n-triples we support that format as well. 

The code for the RDF import can be found in the package [nl.knaw.huygens.timbuctoo.rdf](https://github.com/HuygensING/timbuctoo/tree/master/timbuctoo-instancev4/src/main/java/nl/knaw/huygens/timbuctoo/rdf)

== Import
There are two options to import data. 
The first one is can be found at http://localhost:8080/static/bulk-upload/.
This way you can upload a file with n-quads and n-triples.
If you want to call the endpoint directly, use http://localhost:8080/v2.1/rdf/import with the Content-Type 'multipart/form-data'.
The form needs a 'VRE_ID'-field and a 'file'-field that contains a file with the triples to upload.

The other possibility is that you POST several lines of n-quads of n-triples to the resource http://localhost:8080/v2.1/rdf/import. 
This requires the headers 'VRE_ID' and 'Content-Type' to be set. 
The 'VRE_ID' can be set to a name of VRE that does not exist yet. 
The Content-Type must be 'application/n-quads'.
The body should contain the triples, with one line for each triple.

If you have a large amount of data or a file containing your triples you want to use the first option. 
If you just want to try to import a few triples the second option would be an easier choice.

Both imports will create a VRE with the name provided by the header VRE_ID or filled in in the field of the for of the bulk-upload. (Wat gebeurd er met de graph URI van de quad?) 
After the import has completed you can find your data in the [Edit GUI](http://localhost:8080/static/edit-gui/) under the dropdown of the VRE you chose the importer to create.

=== Process
When the data is uploaded, it is processed by the RdfImporter. 
The RdfImport prepares the import, by creating a new VRE. Then it delegates the import of the triples to the TripleImporter. 
The TripleImporter lets a TripleProcessor execute one of the [supported cases](#supported-cases). 
These TripleProcessors add the data to the database. 
They also add the necessary configuration to the database. 
This configuration could be adding a new Collection to the database or adding a Property configuration to a Collection.
 
==== Supported cases
We support 4 types of triples. 
These 4 types seem to are enough to support most of the rdf language.

 1. Triples that describe a http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf with a for Timbuctoo known archetype.
 When the object contains no known archetype this subClassOf relation will be treated like every other relation.
 2. Triples that describe http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#type.
 3. Triples where the object is a literal.
 4. Triples where the object is another resource. This includes subClassOf with a type that is not known as archetype in Timbuctoo.
 
Each of the cases has its own TripleProcessor in the [triple processor package](https://github.com/HuygensING/timbuctoo/tree/master/timbuctoo-instancev4/src/main/java/nl/knaw/huygens/timbuctoo/rdf/tripleprocessor).

=== Hierarchy
An import can result in a combination of the next 3 scenario's.   

==== No type information available
This is the most basic one. For example when the first triple of the VRE has not http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#type predicate, the newly created vertex will be added to the 'unknown'-collection of the VRE.

==== A type without a connection with a known archetype
When type information becomes available, the structure will be transformed to the next structure.

image::images/default_hierarchy.png["Default hierarchy."]

==== A type with a known archetype
When the type is http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf of a Timbuctoo known archetype. 
The structure will be transformed to the following structure.

== Dependencies
We use [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) to convert the triple strings to java objects.


== Known issues

Timbuctoo supports edges with inverse names for inverse directions in a data structure called RelationType. 
Currently mapping via URI of an rdf predicate only works for the regular name of a relation type.

For instance, given these triples:

```
<amsterdam> <isDeathPlaceOf> <piet> .
<jan> <hasBirthPlace> <Amsterdam> .
```

And a RelationType definition as follows:

```
{
  ..., 
  "regularName": "hasDeathPlace",
  "inverName": "isDeathPlaceOf",
  "sourceType: "person",
  "targetType: "location"
}
```

We currently get these resulting edges:

```
v[73] --[isDeathPlaceOf]--> v[72]
v[65] --[hasBirthPlace]--> v[73]
```

Where isDeathPlaceOf is a newly generated relationType, in stead of one mapped against the existing relationType.

The expected result would have been:

```
v[72]--[hasDeathPlace]-->v[73]
v[65] --[hasBirthPlace]--> v[73]
```

Culprit code only looks at RDF_URI_PROP identifying a regular name.

```
rdf.Database.java[r215]:  graphWrapper.getGraph().traversal().V().hasLabel("relationtype").has(RDF_URI_PROP, predicate.getURI());
```
