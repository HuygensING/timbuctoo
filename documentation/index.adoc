== Introduction

=== Background

include::../README.adoc[tags=background] 

A lot of applications go quite some part of the distance however, so timbuctoo mostly glue between these applications.

=== History

Timbuctoo was started in 2012.

include::./compiling.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Software Components

=== Overview

Timbuctoo is a set of REST api's on top of a graph database that stores RDF. gloss:REST[http api]

Changelog::
  todo:feature["The changelog will provide a chronological list of additions or deletions filtered by either the entity or the dataset"].
  The changelog API isn't available yet, but the data to generate it is already being saved. So when the API becomes available it will expose the data retroactively.  
RDF-publication::
  todo:feature["We will publish the RDF data in the CLARIAH RDF exchange format"].
The V2.1 API::
  CRUD::
include::{javasourcesdir}/crud/README.adoc[tags=summary] 
  Metadata::
    A dataset contains information about the property names (predicates) that are in use etc.
    This information cannot be retrieved from the CRUD endpoint, but can be retrieved from here.
    This module is not really documented, you can read link:{javasourcesdir}/server/endpoints/v2/Metadata.java[the source] though.
  Autocomplete::
    Timbuctoo allows you to do a quick search on the labels (aka displaynames) of the entities.
    This is implemented as part of the CRUD module.  
Tabular data importer::
include::{javasourcesdir}/bulkupload/README.adoc[tags=summary] 
RML processor::
include::{javasourcesdir}/rml/README.adoc[tags=summary] 
RDF importer::
include::{javasourcesdir}/rdf/README.adoc[tags=summary]
Resource sync::
include::{javasourcesdir}/remote/rs/README.adoc[tags=summary]
Search GUI & Index crawler::
== Summary

These ruby scripts harvest the timbuctoo CRUD endpoint, format the data and send it to solr.

//include::{scriptsourcesdir}/index_scripts/README.adoc[tags=summary]
Discover-GUI::
  A gui that is not aimed at precise querying, but rather to get a high-level overview of the data so that you know what queries to write.
Dataset-search::
  find subjects using their properties and then find the datasets that contain them
Data curation tools::
  Tools for cleaning up datasets. We're mostly implementing this by working together with existing tools.
Data-export::
  Render the timbuctoo data as RDF, graphviz and whatnot. This epic might also focus on generating data representations in a semantic form that can be well imported by other tools. (i.e. use the proper date-time encoding or geo-coordinates encoding)
Dataset-interdependencies:: Be able to depend on other datasets.
  * Link to RDF subjects in a specific other dataset
  * todo:feature["Import (parts of) other datasets into your own dataset"]
  * todo:feature["Create a new (read-only?) dataset that is fully dependent on other datasets"]

Next to these core endpoints we also have:

An authentication endpoint::
  This allows users to sign in.
  We will probably remove the code once the project that we're part of (CLARIAH) provides a good openid2 implementation.
Authorization handling::
  todo:feature["User management that specifies who is allowed to see your data"]. Currently only a basic form is implemented (only you are allowed to edit your own datasets).
A D3 graph render endpoint::
  This will probably be removed after we have built the new CRUD Api
A raw query endpoint::
  This is for development use only
A jsenv endpoint::
  This is a quick way to pass some data from the configuration file to the javascript applications.
  We're not sure if we're keeping this around.

These are all the user facing components. Other packages are supporting these components.
