= Support for Custom Schema

== The problem
Currently, Timbuctoo only supports auto-generated Schema.
Users do not have the ability to extend on the auto-generated schema for their datasets.

== The result
Users are able to add custom schema to the dataset's auto-generated schema
via graphQL mutations.

== The approach

. Implement mergeSchema function to combine two given schemas.
.. The merge function will accept two maps (type: Map<String,Type>) that will then
be combined.
.. It is an important characteristic that users should only be able to add to the schema i.e expand it
   and not retract anything. Depecation is, however, allowed.
.. A helper function mergePredicates will be implemented to handle the specific predicate cases:
... A property may be added, but not removed.
... A property may receive a new union type, but not have one removed.
... A singular property may be turned into a list, but not the other way around
... checking validity of 'Name', 'Direction' and 'Owner' properties.
... Merging the 'Reference' and 'Value' types.
... Deprecation is allowed
.. The merge function will return  a new Map<String,Type> which will be the merged map.
. Implement GraphQL mutation to merge schemas.
.. This will be a GraphQL call that allows the User to specify the custom schema extension for the dataset.
. Add a call to MergeSchema in the SchemaStore class.
. There will always be one generated schema and one custom schema i.e. further extensions will be added
to the same custom schema.
