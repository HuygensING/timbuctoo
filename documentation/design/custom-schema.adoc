= Support for Custom Schema

== The problem
Currently, Timbuctoo only supports auto-generated Schema.
Users do not have the ability to extend on the auto-generated schema for their datasets.

== The result
Users are able to add custom schema to the dataset's auto-generated schema
via graphQL mutations.

== The approach

. Implement mergeSchema function to combine two given schemas.
.. The merge function will accept two maps (type: Map<String,Type>) that will then
be combined.
.. A helper function mergePredicates will be implemented to handle the specific predicate cases:
... maintaining 'List' property.
... maintaining 'Public' property.
... checking validity of 'Name', 'Direction' and 'Owner' properties.
... Merging the 'Reference' and 'Value' types.
.. The merge function will return  a new Map<String,Type> which will be the merged map.
. Implement GraphQL mutation to merge schemas.
.. This will be a GraphQL call that allows the User to specify the custom schema extension for the dataset.
. Add a call to MergeSchema in the SchemaStore class.
