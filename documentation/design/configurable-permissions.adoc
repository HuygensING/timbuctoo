= Configurable Permissions

== The problem
* All permissions hardcoded to roles
** All instances of Timbuctoo have the same permissions for the same roles

=== Scope
* Only RDF Timbuctoo not the legacy version that is supporting Women Writers.

=== User Roles
* __**L0: Anonymous user**__: only published datasets
* *L1: Reader - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
* *L2: Contributor - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
* *L3: Editor - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
* *L4: Administrator - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
* __**L5: Site administrator**__: Timbuctoo instance
** The super users of the instances, these should be configured with a system administrator

The list above is an example to give an impression what could be possible.
Though every application will have multiple _Anonymous users_ and one or more _Site administrators_.

== Definition of done
. The owner of the Timbuctoo instance can assign all the permissions to roles of her of his liking.
. All permissions are defined in the code.

== Tasks
. Identify the spots Timbuctoo needs limited accessibility.
.. Add permission checks, if no checks are available.
. Think of a way how the permissions are going to be checked.
. Make the permissions configurable.
. Add a migration from the old to the new structure.
