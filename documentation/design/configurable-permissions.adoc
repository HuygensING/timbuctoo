= Configurable Permissions

== The problem
* All permissions hardcoded to roles
** All instances of Timbuctoo have the same permissions for the same roles

=== Scope
* Only RDF Timbuctoo not the legacy version that is supporting Women Writers.

=== User Roles
. __**L0: Anonymous user**__: only published datasets
. *L1: Reader - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
. *L2: Contributor - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
. *L3: Editor - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
. *L4: Administrator - datasets*: both all published + spec. assigned datasets
. __**L5: Site administrator**__: Timbuctoo instance

=== Allowed actions
* Upload RDF
* Update resourcesync
* Edit existing data (GraphQL mutation)
* Give users permission to data set
* Create a new data set
*
