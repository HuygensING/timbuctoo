# Import status

## Problems

There are two problems with the import status.

### Information not usable for GUI
The two current import status GraphQl Types `CurrentImportStatus` and `DataSetImportStatus` only contain a high overview of the whole import.
It cannot tell you what the progress is on the file you just uploaded.

### Concurrency errors that make our integration tests fail some time
The `CurrentImportStatus` has some concurrency problems.
It sometimes says it has no errors when the import failed.

## Solution

### GraphQlDesign

Output

```
"dataSetImportStatus": {
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "value",
      "status": "PENDING" | "IMPORTING" | "DONE"
    }
  ]
}
```

```
"importStatus": {
  "id": "value",
  "status": "PENDING" | "IMPORTING" | "DONE"
  "source": "original.fileName",
  "errors": ["error", "messages"],
  "progress" : {
    {
      "label": "",
      "status": "PENDING" | "IMPORTING" | "DONE",
      "progress": "number of units processed",
      "speed": "number of units processed per second"
    }
  }
```

Input
```
importStatus(id: "") {
  id
  ...
}
```

### Changes in Timbuctoo
* Make import status classes synchronized
