This document describes the workflow of the Huygens team for adding new functionality to Timbuctoo.

. Write an http://asciidoctor.org[ascii-doc] (make sure it has the extension adoc) doc that contains the following parts:
* What problem does the work solve?
* What should be the result of the work?
* What will be the approach?
. Add the document to the folder design in the documentation folder in the root folder of Timbuctoo.
.. Create a new branch.
.. Commit and push the changes.
. Create a pull request for the document.
. Process the feedback of your peers.
. When the document is approved you can start writing the code.
* Write code on the same branch you created for the document.
* Keep the branch up-to-date with master.
. When the code is complete create a pull request for the changed code.
