= Refactor DataSet

== Problem
This proposed refactoring should solve several problems.

. The responsibilities are not clearly divided.
. The code is dependent on our Berkeley data store implementations.

A combination of the problems above led to a bug that did not close the data stores correctly, when Timbuctoo was shutdown.

== Result
The responsibilities are moved to the right classes and packages.
DataSet is not directly dependent on the Berkeley data stores


== Approach
. Remove the direct dependency on Berkeley data stores.
.. Create a factory that has creation methods for all the data stores
.. Extract missing interfaces for data stores
. Make one class responsible for the lifecycle of the Berkeley data stores
