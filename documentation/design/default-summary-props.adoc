= Default summary props

== The problem
After RDF upload the data can be browsed in the Timbuctoo GUI.
The browsing is not very pleasant because the overview does not show any information just a view entry button.
The only way it is possible to show any data is to configure summary properties (title, description, depiction)
This configuration can only be done direct via the GraphQL API, at this moment.
So it is impossible to configured without any technical knowledge.

== Expected result
To have "decent" results after each RDF upload, there should be a possibility to configure defaults for _titles_, _descriptions_ and _depictions_.
The configuration should be done in the configuration of Timbuctoo, so it can be different for each instance.
Users must be able to override the defaults, with the current summary props graphql mutations.
So if a user configures summary properties this should be used instead of the system defaults.

== Solution
To achieve the expected result the following steps should be taken:

* The Entity interface in GraphQL should get the properties _title_, _description_ and _depiction_.
* A DataFetcher should be created that handles these properties and that looks up the value
** It should check properties in the following order
. Configured by the user.
. The default properties in order they are configured.
* The configuration should look like:
```
...
defaultTitles:
- type: SimplePath
  path: ["http://skos.org/label"] # path to a property directly linked to the entity
- type: SimplePath
  path: ["http://schema.org/birthPlace", "http://rdfs.org/label"] # path to a property of a property linked to the entity
...
```
