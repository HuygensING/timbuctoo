= Ability to add another User as an Editor or Admin to your Dataset

. Problem:
* Timbuctoo currently has no provisions to allow a user to give Admin/Editor permissions to another user to their
dataSet.

. Result:
* Users will be able to add another User to their dataSet and assign permissions for them using a GraphQl mutation.

. Approach:
* A graphQL mutation of the following format will be added:
----
 mutation assignUser {
   assignUser (dataSetId: <dataset_id>) {
     user_id: <user_id>,
     role: <role>
   }
 }
----

Using the mutation will add the specified role to the specified user for the specified dataSet by adding an entry in
authorizations.json file.

Note: This mutation/functionality will only be available for someone with Admin permissions to the dataSet.
