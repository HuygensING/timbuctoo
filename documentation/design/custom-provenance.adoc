= Edit mutations custom provenance

== Use case
This feature is an expansion on the link:edit-mutations.adoc[Edit mutations] feature.
The current edit mutations will add some standard Timbuctoo / PROV-O provenance.
With this feature we would like to give the use the opportunity to add some extra documentation on why the change is made.

== Requirements
* The admin of a data set should be able to define a structure of the custom provenance.
* The GraphQL schema should limit the user to the defined schema. (like how the rest of the edit mutations work)


== Design

=== GraphQL

=== Java
