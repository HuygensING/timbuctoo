= Add support for users to be able to add alternative redirection services (in addition to 'handle') to Timbuctoo

== Problem:
Currently, Timbuctoo only supports the Handle redirection service. It's not easy for Timbuctoo users to integrate other
redirection services as the configuration for the Handle redirection is hard-coded into Timbuctoo.

== Result:
The hard-coded integration of Handle redirection service will be removed. Redirection service will now have to be
specified instead in the Timbuctoo configuration. The users will be able to write implementations for their desired
redirection service and configure Timbuctoo to use a new redirection service.

The user will be able to do so as follows:

=== Steps to add a desired redirection service to Timbuctoo and configure Timbuctoo to use it:
- In the example_config.yaml file, change  the "redirectionService" property and child properties values to your
new implementation.

For example, Timbuctoo default:
----
redirectionService:
    "@class": nl.knaw.huygens.timbuctoo.v5.redirectionService.HandleRedirectionServiceFactory
    useDummy: yes #set to "no" to connect to a real handle server
    #  privateKeyFile:
    #  cypher:
    #  namingAuthority:
    #  prefix:
----

can be changed to use your new Bitly implementation as:
----
redirectionService:
    "@class": nl.knaw.huygens.timbuctoo.v5.redirectionService.BitlyUrlCreatorServiceFactory
    user: Example User
    authKey: ${BITLY_AUTH_KEY}
    # ...
----

NOTE: It's the user's responsibility to make sure that the configuration parameters required by the the implementation
are added to the configuration file.

The factory class mentioned above should then be able to use the specified information to build a redirection service.

The factory class should implement the RedirectionServiceFactory interface (new) and thus implement the
"makeRedirectionService" function to create the new redirection service.

This new implementation class for the redirection service should implement the RedirectionService interface and thus
implement the "add" function.


== Approach:

- The initial step will be to add support to one more redirection service as a test case, in addition to Handle.
Bit.ly was chosen as the service as it has a Java library available.

NOTE: We are using Bit.ly for testing purposes to make sure that the new way of setting up redirection services works
with Timbuctoo. Bit.ly will **not** be available as an option in production instances.

- Currently, handleAdder, specific to the handle service, is added directly to Timbuctoo. We need to change this so that
the user can configure any implementation of the PersistenceUrlCreator in place of the handleAdder.

- A RedirectionServiceFactory interface will be created that will be structured as follows:

----
public interface RedirectionServiceFactory {
    RedirectionService makeRedirectionService();
}
----

- A RedirectionService abstract calss will also be created and structured as follows:

----
public abstract class RedirectionService {
    void init();

    public final void oldAdd(URI uriToRedirectTo, EntityLookup entityLookup){
        ..do queing
        call processRequestOld
    }

    public final void add(URI uriToRedirectTo, EntityLookup entityLookup){
        ..do queing
        call processRequest
    }

    protected abstract processRequest(); //handle specific/bitly specific code

    protected abstract processRequestOld(); //handle specific/bitly specific code

}
----

- Current handle service will be refactored to meet the above specification.

This means we will now have a HandleServiceFactory that extends the RedirectionServiceFactory:
----
public class HandleServiceFactory implements RedirectionServiceFactory {
    @JsonCreator
    public HandleServiceFactory(@JsonProperty("useDummy") boolean useDummy,
        @JsonProperty("privateKeyFile") String privateKeyFile, ...) {
        ...
    }

    RedirectionService makeRedirectionService() {
        ...
    }
}
----

Here, makeRedirectionService will return a:
----
public class HandleService extends RedirectionService {
    void processRequest(..){
        ...
    }
    void processOldRequest(...){
        ...
    }
}
----

- Similarly, we will implement the RedirectionServiceFactory and RedirectionService classes for Bit.ly service (for test
purposes) as follows:

This means we will now have a BitlyServiceFactory that extends the RedirectionServiceFactory:
----
public class BitlyServiceFactory implements RedirectionServiceFactory {
    @JsonCreator
    public HandleServiceFactory(@JsonProperty("user") String user,
        @JsonProperty("authKey") String authKey, ...) {
        ...
    }

    RedirectionService makeRedirectionService() {
        ...
    }
}
----

Here, makeRedirectionService will return a:
----
public class BitlyService extends RedirectionService {
    void processRequest(..){
        ...
    }
    void processOldRequest(...){
        ...
    }
}
----

- This Bit.lyService will use the [Bit.ly Java API client](https://github.com/stackmagic/bitly-api-client)

- The Bit.ly client will be used to call the Java client library as follows:

----
ShortenResponse respShort = new ShortenRequestBuilder("... the access token ...") //
    .setLongUrl("https://example-timbuctoo-url/") //
    .call();
----

== Testing Redirection

To test that the Redirection Service is working correctly in Timbuctoo after the refactoring a GraphQL mutation will
be added. A REST endpoint for entity retrieval is also necessary.

=== GraphQL endpoint:

The GraphQL mutation structure will be as follows;
----
persistEntity(dataSetId: String!, entityUri: String!): String! #persistentUri
----

This mutation will be implemented in the persistEntityMutation class that implements DataFetcher.
The mutation will validate if the entity at the given entityUri exists and will call the 'add' function in the currently configured RedirectionService class (HandleService by default).

The GraphQL endpoint will be tested manually by making sure that the persistentUri that is returned, when called in a web browser, redirects to a Timbuctoo entity.

=== REST endpoint

A REST endpoint called getEntity will be created as well. It will have the structure:
----
<timbuctoo_uri>/v5/{dataSetId}/{collection}/{id}
----

NOTE: The 'id' should be Url-encoded.

Normal case (user has access to dataSet and provided collection and id are valid):

. The given id will be decoded and the QuadStore will be used to retrieve the CursorQuads for the subject (id).
. The CursorQuads will be converted to Triples and then to Json-LD using Rdf4j and the Json-LD will be returned.

Case where user has no access to dataSet:

. If the dataSet is public then proceed as 'normal case' above if not return 'Unauthorized'

Case where collection and/or id are incorrect:

. Return 'Collection/Id not found'

The various cases for the REST endpoint will be tested manually by calling the endpoint Url.

NOTE: After the service creates the persistent id it should be saved to the entity in the dataSet.
(refer to addPid use by HandleService)

=== Handle service support for new Timbuctoo

Currently, the Handle service is only used by old Timbuctoo so the same functionality also needs to be added to new Timbuctoo.
This will require some refactoring in addition to the new 'add' function.

. The RedirectionService interface (from initial refactoring) will be converted to an abstract class.
. The 'add' method will be changed to 'old_add' and a new 'add' method will be added.
These will correspond respectively to 'add' functions for old and new Timbuctoos.
Every new implementation of a redirection service will have to implement methods.
. RedirectionService will also contain abstract methods that have to be implemented specifically by interfaces.
. Queuing will be handled in the RedirectionService abstract class (so that implementations do not have to worry about it).
. The HandleService class will now extend this abstract class.
. The new 'add' function will have to write generated persistent ids to the triple store.
