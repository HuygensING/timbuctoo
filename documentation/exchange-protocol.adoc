= Resource sync

== Data model

The http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.1/resourcesync[resource sync specification] describes how various documents interlink in order to describe a set of resources and where the entrypoints should be placed.
In it's simplest form it is just one file containing a directory listing with a predefined name.
This is needed because the HTTP spec itself does not define a "list" command.
Resourcesync is a set of embellishments on the sitemap.xml de-facto standard.
Timbuctoo uses resourcesync to discover datasets at a source and to get the list of files that comprise the dataset.

The document linked above provides the full spec, but we found it convenient to draw a picture of the various documents:

The horizontal arrows indicate entrypoints.
If you provide timbuctoo (or another resourcesync destination) with a url it may try to find a link header/link tag, a resourcesync file in the folder .well-known at the root of the server, or a robots.txt.
Each file provides links downwards, optionally they might also provide a link upwards.
A source description contains links to one or more capability lists, each list is considered to contain 1 dataset by timbuctoo.

NOTE: each capabilitylist is treated as 1 "dataset". Another instance will import a whole dataset, not a part of it.

A capability list will link to one or more files via a resource (index) list.
All files in the resource list are considered to be part of the same dataset.
A capability list may also point to a resource dump and/or changesets, these features are optional and should be provided in addition to the resource list.

So to create a resourcesync capable server for timbuctoo you should:

 1. Put a http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.0.9/resourcesync#ex_7[source description] at `/.well-known/resourcesync` on your server
 2. Fill it with links to http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.0.9/resourcesync#ex_6[capability lists] (1 per dataset that you wish to publish)
 3. Fill them with links to http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.0.9/resourcesync#ex_1[Resource lists]
 4. Fill those with links to the actual data files in one of the supported rdf formats (see below)

You may use the `describedby` mechanism (see http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.1/resourcesync#DocumentFormats[]) to point to documents that describe your datasets. 
These description documents can be in any format, however, using one of the RDF-formats is recommended. 
Timbuctoo interprets http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.1/resourcesync#CapabilityList[capabilitylist's] as description of a dataset. 
Therefore expects that the metadata of a `capabilitylist` will contain the `describedby` mechanism. 
This `describedBy` item can either be added to a url in the sourcedescription or to the root item of the `capabilitylist`.

=== Valid resources
Timbuctoo cannot sync every filetype on the internet, only files containing rdf in several of the more well-known serialisation formats.
To indicate the serialisation format you can specify the mimetype in the optional `md` field (meta data field) for each url from the resource list.
Alternatively you can use a file extension to indicate the type of file.
The explicit mimetype overrules the file extension.

The filetypes that we can currently import are:

 * text/turtle (.ttl)
 * application/rdf+xml (.rdf)
 * application/n-triples (.nt)
 * application/ld+json (.jsonld)
 * application/trig (.trig)
 * application/n-quads (.nq)
 * text/n3 (.n3)
 * application/vnd.timbuctoo-rdf.nquads_unified_diff (.nqud)

NOTE: We require now that every dataset to be imported into Timbuctoo have a file (in a supported rdf format) that is
named "dataset.<rdf extension>". After the dataset is imported into Timbuctoo every change done will
be in a changelist (in nquads-ud format, described below) for this "dataset" rdf file.
The extra files that are uploaded along with the dataset will simply be stored in the Timbuctoo
filesystem.

So we expect an item resource list will look like:

```
...
<url>
    <loc>http://localhost/.well-known/resourcesync/dataset1/dataset.nq</loc>
    <rs:md type="application/n-quads"/> <!-- this line is optional, but can be used to override the extension -->
</url>
...
```

Changes (additions and retractions) made in Timbuctoo will be stored in the changelist for dataset.<rdf extension> file
 that is in the nquads-ud format (see below)

== N-Quads U.D.
N-Quads U.D. stands for N-Quads Unified Diff.
It is an extension on the RDF N-Quads notation.

== Why another RDF notation?
RDF data set notations are like snapshots.
They have no visible history.
Look at the example an n-triples data set:
```
<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/country> "The Netherlands" .
<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/longitude> "436052"^^<http://schema.org/longitude> .
<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Places> .
<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/latitude> "5200951"^^<http://schema.org/latitude> .
<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/original_id> "PL00000029" .
```
How do know if one of these predicates has had a previous value?

To facilitate sharing of datasets between two parties we need to make sure that a dataset does not change under your feet. 
For Timbuctoo we needed a way to change a data without changing its history.
So the first thing we did was looking at ideas that were already floating around on the internet.
We found one called https://afs.github.io/rdf-patch/[RDF Patch] and another one called https://www.w3.org/TR/ldpatch/[Linked Data Patch Format].

=== Why didn't we use RDF Patch?
At first glance RDF Patch looks like the ideal solution for our problem.
So we tried to write a piece of code that allowed us to import the notation.
But we got stuck pretty quickly.
The main reason is there are basically no libraries that parse RDF Patch.
That is also true if you define you own standard.
Another reason is that it was not simple to writer the parser ourselves.
The next example will show the most complex form of RDF Patch:
```
@prefix  foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
D <http://example/bob> foaf:name "bob" .
A <http://example/bob> foaf:name "Bob" .
A R foaf:knows <http://example/alice> .
A R R <http://example/charlie> .
```
This is when we decided we should make a less complex notation.

=== Why didn't we use Linked Data Patch Format?
Linked Data Patch Format is very hard to generate automatically. 
The patch statements are not about what changed, but more about the intent of the user.
We wanted a format that people without much knowledge of RDF could generate with more-or-less standard tools.

== Notation
Because our notation should be simpler than RDF Patch we created an extension on N-Quads.
N-Quads it self is an extension on N-Triples, so we support both.

The format for the additions and deletions we decided to use http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Detailed-Unified.html#Detailed-Unified[Unified].

Here's an example:
```
+<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/country> "The Netherland" .
-<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/country> "The Netherlands" .
+<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/longitude> "436052"^^<http://schema.org/longitude> .
+<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Places> .
+<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/latitude> "5200951"^^<http://schema.org/latitude> .
+<http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/datasets/clusius/Place_PL00000029> <http://timbuctoo.huygens.knaw.nl/properties/original_id> "PL00000029" .
```

A processor MUST ignore all lines that do not start with a single `+` or `-`.
So the extra info that is often part of the unified diff format is also allowed:

```

+++ update.nq  2017-07-19 11:18:16.057104790 +0200

```

An advantage of choosing the unified format is that is easy to generate for people using N-Quads or N-Triples in combination with a Unix (Linux, Mac OS X) system:
```
sort prev.nq > prev_sorted.nq
sort update.nq > update_sorted.nq
diff --unified=0 prev_sorted.nq update_sorted.nq > updates.nqud
```

== Media type and file extension
We chose to use the `application/vnd.timbuctoo-rdf.nquads_unified_diff` as media type.
The file extension is `.nqud`.
